Here you can read about my thoughts, ideas, and dreams on things that capture my attention. Topics can vary wildly, but I hope you enjoy each rabbit hole no matter how emphemeral it may be. Feel free to browse the blog for (hopeflly) regular updates!

There are an endless number of things to be fascinated by so Im starting this website as a way to document my hobbies, discoveries, and adventures. I love most interactive things and specifically ones that let me use my hands.

My favorite places in no particular order are Emmigrant Wilderness, Golden Gate Park, youtube.com, and anywhere with a good tide pool.
