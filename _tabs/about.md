There are an endless number of things to be fascinated by so Im starting this website as a way to document my hobbies, discoveries, and adventures. I love most interactive things and specifically ones that let me use my hands.

My favorite places in no particular order are Emmigrant Wilderness, Golden Gate Park, youtube.com, and anywhere with a good tide pool.
