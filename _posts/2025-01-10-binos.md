In maybe my most surprising puchase of 2024 on a former rabbit hole journey, I became the proud owner of a fabulous pair of binos. Overnight I went from never thinking twice when my dad pulled out his trusty pair that he carried on family vacations to planning what size carry on to bring on my own trips to account for a 10 lb pair and all of its accessories. When you need binoculars, nothing else will do.
